"""The ABAC policy engine - the authority on who may read what.

Design rules this file exists to enforce:

1.  **Deny overrides.** Any rule that denies wins, regardless of what else allows.
2.  **The policy engine is the authority; the index filter is only an optimisation.**
    The same `decide()` function runs twice - once compiled into a vector-store
    pre-filter (cheap, approximate, fast) and once against freshly resolved
    attributes after retrieval (authoritative). If the two ever disagree, the
    post-check wins and the discrepancy is logged as a security event.
3.  **The LLM is never an enforcement point.** No prompt says "do not reveal X".
    Unauthorised text simply never reaches the model.

Rules are ordered and explicit so a reviewer - or an interviewer - can read the
policy top to bottom without running it.
